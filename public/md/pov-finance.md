#Industry Point of View - Financial Markets (FSM)

Cloud comprises two main categories of computing resources. First are the networks, servers, and storage that form the foundation of a private, public, or hybrid cloud environment. This is often referred to as Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS). The second category includes applications and solutions that cloud providers make available “as a service.” A common example is Software as a Service (SaaS). The transformative potential of cloud is created by 3 main things which are speed, empowerment, and economics. Now how these things are accomplished pertaining to the financial markets is something that we have gone to great lengths in uncovering for you the seller.

With global financial uncertainty and the rise of increased demands from both regulators and clients alike, the financial industry in under increased pressure that threatens their return on equity. Cost-to-income ratios remain stubbornly high and pre-tax profits for the top 250 banks are stagnant, while 3-year average operating costs are up nearly 5 percent. Because of this, constructive changes on how to most effectively mitigate this problem have been welcomed as well as the increased need for the financial sector to gain an edge through various other tools that cloud platforms have to offer. Many firms are turning to cloud in order to more flexibly deploy computing resources based on shifting business demands, reducing costs and simplifying IT infrastructure. But increasingly, cloud is being used by firms to create new business models, speed the development and adoption of new services, and drive standardization, which improves data quality and effectiveness.

However, some firms struggle to identify what is "cloudable," or in other words what can and cant be out in the cloud and in which context, with security and regulatory issues being a big concern. In all cases firms need to design cloud strategies that offer the right combination of public, private, and hybrid cloud that maximizes the benefits, while securing their data and commercially sensitive information.
Firms of all sizes are turning to cloud-based services to enhance business functions for everything from advanced data analytics to compliance activities and HR. This “everything-as-a-service” approach is already creating real business advantage by aggregating risk loss events across operations to drive efficiency and control of risk management. It is also enabling trading infrastructure-as-a-service that exploits the latest high-performance technology. And it is speeding up the development and deployment of new services to both internal and external stakeholders, to help manage and enable growth and new partnerships.
