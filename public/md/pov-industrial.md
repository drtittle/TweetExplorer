Cloud in Electronics
The electronics industry is in a state of disruption. Aggressive new competition, commoditizing products, and shortening lifecycles are putting pressure on margins, driving an industry-wide need to contain costs. At the same time, consumers are demanding ever-more rapid innovation and greater interconnectivity (even as they demonstrate less brand loyalty than ever).  And the products themselves must operate amidst a complex ecosystem of networks, platforms, and business environments. 
Maintaining a prominent role within the electronics industry requires that new business models and better products are created. The foundation of electronics down to the level of semi conductors and components have to be enhanced due to the rapid development. 
In a cloud environment, computing capacity needed to enhance the foundational level of the electronics industry can be provided. This reduces fixed costs and relieves pressure on margins. The development time usually associated will also decrease due to resources being readily available via cloud. Cloud supports the development of new service-oriented business models such as those at the intersection of the internet, communications, and entertainment. 
In summary, forward-looking electronics companies are looking to cloud to:

•	Enable new business models built around services and analytics

•	Accelerate product development times

•	Simplify IT infrastructure and reduce costs
