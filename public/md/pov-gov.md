Cloud in Government
The technological environment in which central and local expand within is becoming constricted due to strict and financial conservatism. Due to this constriction, the manner in which technology is adopted is forced to change. Previously, the “bigger, faster, stronger” view of technology was assisted with hefty budgets to fuel growth. Government spending is now adjusting towards a technology market the is efficient and able to sustain the pace in which digital-savvy citizens expect. Cloud resources such as IBM Bluemix offers a vast array of beneficial means in accordance to IT. Those means include lowered operating and capital costs while maintaining sufficient productivity. 
Cloud adoption in government sectors has been slowed by some legitimate concerns, mostly pertaining to public clouds. Using the Internet as the means to carry government data has both physical and cyber-security risks, and building trusted environments requires thoughtful planning and design of cloud architectures. For this reason, the U.S. Federal Government created a standardized approach to security assessment, authorization, and monitoring for cloud products and services.  The "FedRAMP" program effectively creates an “assess once, use many times” approach to ensuring a secure cloud environment for government applications.
