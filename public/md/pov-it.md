#Industry Point of View- IT/Software Vendors

While the advent of cloud computing has changed the way that most industries do businesses, some often forget how it has change the business of the IT industry itself and how it goes about selling and provisioning for its clients. While before IT was a largely segmented industry with each business having to buy servers, hardware, licenses and to install the software has now seen a consolidation of these efforts into one large data center that can provision service to various companies on demand. Below are just some of the major changes the IT and Software vendor have seen in the past few years. 

**Traditional IT jobs are being changed**, as new skills and specialties are increasingly demanded. Before moving to the cloud, the IT staff will need to fully understand the advantage of cloud computing and how it can be integrated into the current business model. Issues such as security and maintenance should be discussed upfront with the cloud computing vendors, and also a good IT department will have to oversee the migration and the ongoing relationship with the cloud provider.

**The IT Infrastructure will be crucially changed.** This change in infrastructure has and will continue to change the way software vendors distribute their products, moving from physical copies to deploying everything from the cloud. This allow for faster distribution and more importantly updates to patch security holes and release new features. 

**The need for IT support staff is reduced**, due to the fact that now the data will reside of premise with the cloud vendor. However, a new need is created, which is training the employees to work with and understand the new systems and applications.

**The effort to maintain the data is also diminished.** While this is a main benefit for moving to the clouds, some organizations have raised concerns over loss of control and security measures. Although clients might not be comfortable with this fact, they should understand that data in the cloud can be safer than being in-house. 

**Security:**  Cloud providers that offer a managed cloud solution take security very seriously. They are dedicated to this one specific task while in-house IT staff maybe juggling multiple task while working with out of date hardware and software as well as a staff that may have more of a general knowledge but lack the subject specific expertise. This leads me to believe that cloud managed data may actually be safer then in-house operations.  

**Highly customizable software:** Most of the software that companies use is not “cloud-ready”. This is where the software developers intervene, by creating code especially designed for the cloud. With more and more cloud providers making software applications already available and provisioned in the cloud this might become less of a problem as time goes on.
