####Cloud in Federal 
Central and  local governments are adapting to powerful global trends, with one of these trends 
being cloud services. Cloud is already being widely adopted as a means of lowering IT operating and 
capital costs, and some governments have implemented policies to accelerate cloud adoption. Cloud can 
be used to drive internal transformation, build citizen and business-centric ecosystems, and achieve value 
creation within the economy. Today's environment is evolving so it is important that government organizations 
at all levels are focused on creating sustainable economies, improving health and social programs, strengthening
public safety, and enhancing performance and resilience.
